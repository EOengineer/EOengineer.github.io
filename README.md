Naples Ruby Group
===========================

This repository serves as the home of the Naples & SW Florida Ruby Group information webpage.  Naples Ruby Group is commited to promoting an active local development community.  While our focus is on the Ruby language, we promote the exploration and adoption of new tools of any language, and appreciate contributions and facilitations about them.

Naples Ruby Group will meet at some incremental time, TBD.  Stay tuned for more information, and pull requests are welcome.

Initial site framework based off of code from jekyll-foundation-5-starter, a fantastic piece of open source software.
